<p> If you know me at all, you would know that every time I come across a good article, I would feel the need to be a kind soul and share it to everyone whether they care or not. 
<br> And this is no exception. I was just casually reading the news, out of bordem but also on the prowl for some juicy motivation when I came across this.. the first time reading 
<br> the title, it felt like something any typical motivational speaker would say. Look, I have said it many a times too, as I am also a motivational speaker, one my many side-jobs... 
<br> along with the already existing five part-time jobs I am already working my tail off at. So I said to myself, oh what the hell, I have time to read and article and dove right in. 
<br> As soon soon as I finished reading it, I felt the need to spice things up here for you.. or in other words, translate it into everyday language for those who want the motivation
<br> fast and on point. But if you want the full effect, I would really recommend reading the entire article from top to bottom.

Good news folks! NOW, there are dog breeds out there that are low-maintaince and suitable for the average 9-5 or more worker! Whoever said that is impossible clearly 
<br> underestimated the future. Also, be sure to check out the cool article that inspired me to share this new on my blog. When you're done, write me in the comments section 
<br> with your reactions!
